BlockWords
=======

Blockwords is a decentralized adwords platform. It provides a new business model where web users are getting paid directly by advertisers for sharing their private data with them. Blockwords provides a zero middleman advertising platform that allows users to finally benefit from their browsing information without giving up their privacy. Blockwords connects between advertisers and web user in a peer to peer network without publishers, media providers and expensive middleman. By using a unique ad usage algorithm and ethereum smart contract for facilitating micropayment between advertisers and web users, Blockwords is aiming to solve one of the most unbalanced situations in the centralized web world today where data is treated as capital instead of labor.
