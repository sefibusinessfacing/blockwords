BlockWords
==========
Blockwords is a decentralized adwords platform. It provides a new business model where web users are getting paid directly by advertisers for sharing their private data with them. Blockwords provides a zero middleman advertising platform that allows users to finally benefit from their browsing information without giving up their privacy. Blockwords connects between advertisers and web user in a peer to peer network without publishers, media providers and expensive middleman. By using a unique ad usage algorithm and ethereum smart contract for facilitating micropayment between advertisers and web users, Blockwords is aiming to solve one of the most unbalanced situations in the centralized web world today where data is treated as capital instead of labor.

--------------
The Blockwords solution is composed of the following software components:

1. Browser Extension  
2. Campaign Management 
3. Ethereum smart contract for payment settlement
3. Analytics for Users and Advertisers
4. Android client
5. iOS client

At the moment the git repo includes only the first component - Chrome extension. It demonstrates the application from end user perspective.
The extension captures in real time all web user keywords and presents relevant ads directly from the ads repository without any middleman media or system provider (Google or Facebook for example).
In the current version the ads presented in the extension popup screen are simulated. later on they will be integrated with the campaign management service for fetching live in-context ads per keyword.
