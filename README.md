BlockWords
==========
Blockwords is a decentralized adwords platform. It introduces a new business model, RPC - Reward Per Click, where web users are getting paid directly by advertisers for sharing their browsing data. As opposed to existing PPC - Pay Per Click, where payments go to media providers such as Google or Facebook in RPC the payments go to users only. Blockwords provides a zero middleman advertising platform that allows users to finally benefit from sharing their browsing information (without totally giving up their privacy). Blockwords connects between advertisers and web user on-demand without publishers, media providers or other expensive middleman. In contrast with Google, Facebook or other intermediator who places advertising copy on web pages where they think it might be relevant, Blockwords provides a peer to peer direct ads channel where users decide when to share their data and when to watch ads. By using a new Ethereum Data Reward Token DRW to represent data value and a revolutionary adwords eco-system, Blockwords is aiming to solve one of the most unbalanced situations in the centralized web world today where users data is treated as capital instead of labor.


Source Code Content
--------------
Blockwords solution is composed of the following software components:

1. Browser Extension  
2. Campaign Management 
3. Ethereum smart contract for payment settlement
3. Analytics for Users and Advertisers
4. Android client
5. iOS client

At the moment the git repo includes only the first component - Chrome extension. It demonstrates the application from end user perspective.
The extension captures in real time all web user keywords from any web page and presents relevant ads directly from the ads repository without any middleman media or system provider (Google or Facebook for example).
In the current version the ads presented in the extension popup screen are simulated. later on they will be integrated with the campaign management service for fetching live in-context ads per keyword.
